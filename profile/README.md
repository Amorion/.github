Amorium is a dating app which uses __complex machine learning techniques__ to connect you to your soulmate !

In short, we do all the heavy lifting of finding someone with similar interests and you only do the part where you introduce yourself to each other and have all the fun of dating!

We aim to provide users (based on their preferences) with more matches like themselves instead of profiles unlike their own.

We aim to provide users (based on their preferences) with more matches like themselves instead of profiles unlike their own.

## UI Designs

Following the little glimpse of our app, <em>how it looks in iphone 14 pro max</em>
### The home screen for a logged in user looks like:

<img src="./profile/demo1.jpg" width="500">
<img src="./profile/demo2.jpg" width="300" height="600">

### After the system finds a match, the screen looks like

![match screen](./profile/demo3.jpg)

# Working Demo

The project will work like:

<video width="700" height="700" controls><source src="./profile/demo_video.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

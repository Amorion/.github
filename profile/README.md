# Amorium
Amorium is a dating app which uses Agglomerative Clustering and various ML techniques to connect you to your soulmate !

We are using K-Means Clustering or Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering to cluster the dating profiles with one another. We aim to provide users (based on their preferences) with more matches like themselves instead of profiles unlike their own.

## UI Designs
The home screen for a logged in user looks like:
<img src="./project photo 1.jpg" width="500">
<img src="./project photo 2.jpg" width="300" height="600">

After the system finds a match, the screen looks like
![match screen](./project%20photo%203.jpg)

# Demo
The project will work like:

<video width="700" height="700" controls><source src="./project video.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
